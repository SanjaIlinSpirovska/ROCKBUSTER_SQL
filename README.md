# ROCKBUSTER_SQL
This project involves the analysis of data from the fictional movie rental company, Rockbuster Stealth LLC, and utilizes PostgreSQL as the primary tool for conducting the analysis.
## Objective
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart. It already has very good sales, but they
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The objective of this project is to 
perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
## Key Questions
* The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.
* They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.
* Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
* Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.
* The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.
## Data
The dataset comprises of information on the following parameters:
* orders
* products
* departments.
  
The full details of the data are available here.
## Tools
For this project, the following python libraries were used:
+ pandas - for data analysis
+ NumPy - mathematical library that supports a variety of operations, a dependency of pandas
+ seaborn - for visualization
+ matplotlib - a plotting library and a dependency for seaborn
+ scipy - a fundamental Python library necessary for visualizations.
  
The code is available as jupyter notebooks, under /scripts/.
